# Papers with Code RSS Feed

This tool generates RSS feeds for task pages on [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com).

For example, you can subscribe to:

- [Object detection latest](https://granary.io/url?input=jsonfeed&output=atom&url=https://jamesg.blog/pwc/?url=/task/object-detection/latest)
- [Image classification latest](https://granary.io/url?input=jsonfeed&output=atom&url=https://jamesg.blog/pwc/?url=/task/image-classification/latest)
- [Data augmentation latest](https://granary.io/url?input=jsonfeed&output=atom&url=https://jamesg.blog/pwc/?url=/task/data-augmentation/latest)

There is a hosted version of this tool available at `https://granary.io/url?input=jsonfeed&output=atom&url=https://jamesg.blog/pwc/?url=`, which you can use to make requests for task pages. The url structure is:

```
https://granary.io/url?input=jsonfeed&output=atom&url=https://jamesg.blog/pwc/?url=/task/<task_name>
```

Responses are cached for 15 minutes.

## Contributing

This tool doesn't support RSS out of the box because I prefer working with JSON feed. If you'd like to contribute a native RSS version of feeds generated by this tool, this would be sincerely welcomed!
